# Hello, I am Crocodyli :crocodile: ! 
## Welcome to my GitHub profile ðŸ‘‹

Currently, I work as a Threat Intelligence researcher, mapping threat actors and seeking to identify all their tactics, techniques, and procedures used in attacks. 

In addition to working as a researcher, I am a speaker and instructor, teaching courses in the following areas: 
- Malware Analysis
- DFIR (Digital Forensics and Incident Response)
- Investigations of Ransomware Attacks
- Digital Forensics
- Threat Intelligence.

## Interesting Repositories On my GitHub
I have made available repositories that can assist researchers in their day-to-day work, providing everything from tools to the ThreatActors-TTP project.
